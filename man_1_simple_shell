.B shs


.SH # DESCRIPTION 


.The sh utility is a command language interpreter that shall
execute commands read from a command line string, the standard
input, or a specified file.

Pathname expansion shall not fail due to the size of a file.

Shell input and output redirections have an implementation-
defined offset maximum that is established in the open file
description.


.SH # INPUT FILES
.The input file shall be a text file, except that line lengths
shall be unlimited. If the input file consists solely of zero or
more blank lines and comments, sh shall exit with a zero exit
status.


.SH # ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.ENV       .This variable, when and only when an interactive shell
                 is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion
                 (see Section 2.6.2, Parameter Expansion) by the shell,
                 and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of
                 a file containing shell commands to execute in the
                 current environment.  The file need not be executable.
                 If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute
                 pathname, the results are unspecified.  ENV shall be
                 ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and
                 effective group IDs of the process are different.
