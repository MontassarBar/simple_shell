.SH # BUILTINS
ENV       	This variable, when and only when an interactive shell
                 is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion
                 (see Section 2.6.2, Parameter Expansion) by the shell,
                 and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of
                 a file containing shell commands to execute in the
                 current environment.  The file need not be executable.
                 If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute
                 pathname, the results are unspecified.  ENV shall be
                 ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and
                 effective group IDs of the process are different.
